        ReconWood Proto 02 is the second experimental construction prototype
        from the ReconWood project series. It is used to demonstrate the concept
        of Material Digital Twin, an online material database that is directly
        connected to both computational models and physical materials where
        real-time exchange of design, simulation, assembly, and construction
        information can unfold. The individual ReconBlocks are envisioned as
        materials that can “travel” from one structure to another while carrying
        their associated datasets, which allow them to be tracked, traced and
        reused in a data-informed fashion. This data-driven reconfigurability
        extends beyond a pure concept of circularity, as it suggests higher
        design flexibility and formal transformation driven by the material’s
        inherited performance throughout various life cycles. To enable
        reconfiguration in both the design and construction of ReconWood Proto
        02, data circularity is assured equally as material circularity, linking
        material data to a physical material stock.

        The ReconWood Proto 02 is developed as a multi-material and
        multi-resolution timber frame structure, which is structurally optimized
        for the reuse of its parts. The project seeks to balance the
        ever-growing demand for new timber as a construction material and the
        available resources, by introducing re-usable and re-configurable
        discrete wood elements that are computationally generated, robotically
        fabricated and (re)assembled, and that have all of their identity and
        history accessible through embedded QR code imprints. The project
        challenges current building practices and “end-of-life” concepts by
        enabling materials-and-data circularity through information-driven
        design and construction processes.
